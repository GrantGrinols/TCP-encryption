# TCP encryption
 Shows the difference between unencrypted and encrypted messaging

 This project allows you to either:
 1. Send unencrypted messages
 2. Send Encrypted message using the rsa library.

 Both applications only allow you to send messages to yourself with a split-screen console, but this file can easily be modified to commuticate beyond yourself.

 Created for a quick,simple, and educational demostration on TCP encryption.

 This is mostly plug and chug, Add a IPAddress.json file with "Address": "(your ip)"
